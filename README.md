It's a multi-page jewellery website I made with only HTML and CSS. It features a layout that displays different jewellery products across multiple sections and works well on all screen sizes.

## Features

- Home page with a bestseller section, shop-by-product categories, and an about section  
- CSS-only hamburger menu and a footer  
- Multi-page layout containing different jewellery products

I built this project to improve my CSS skills and get more confident with responsive design before moving on to JavaScript. It helped me better understand structure, spacing, and how to make a website that actually feels good to use.
